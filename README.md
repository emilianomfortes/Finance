# Finance

This repository contains the application of finance concepts computationally with real up-to-date data using Python. This is the starting version, which will be updated while I keep learning.

At the present time, it contains the following examples:

1) Downloading stock-markets data from online providers using Pandas DataReader. The data is stored inside Pandas DataFrames.

2) Calculating rates of return of a stock (simple & logarithmic).

3) Calculating the rate-of-return of an investment portfolio and how such a portfolio is defined.

4) Understanding market indices.

5) Risk assessment of stocks. Covariance and correlation.

6) Markowitz portfolio theory and the efficient frontier.

7) Performance of a stock vs the market.

8) Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), expected returns and Sharpe's ratio.
